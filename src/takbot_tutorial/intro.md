# Takbot Tutorial

Let's make a bot that plays Tak!

The tutorial is organized into bite-sized chapters that build on each other.
We will start with an implementation of the game and slowly build up.
We will go from a random bot to a hopefully interesting bot that you can customize
and extend as you wish. I would view this tutorial as just a jumping-off point
to get you started on your bot-making journey.

## Prerequisites

You will need to know:
- fundamentals of the [Python] programming language
- rules of [Tak] (you can try it on [playtak])

[Tak]: https://ustak.org/play-beautiful-game-tak/

## Python is a Plastic Fork

Python is honestly a bad choice for a Tak bot because Python is horrendously slow.
The goal of this tutorial is not to create the best bot.
Rather, the goal is to get people playing around and experimenting with bot-making
and just programming in general. For this, Python seems like the best choice
because it is popular and easy to learn.
